## APIs 
A common way to first understand what APIs (Application Programming Interfaces) are is with the analogy of a restaurant and a waiter. <br>
In the analogy, you, the ***Client***, ***request*** an item from the menu. The waiter is the ***interface*** between you and the kitchen. <br>
* You will ***REQUEST*** an item to the waiter
* The waiter will then tell the kitchen your request
* When done, the waiter will bring the kitchen's ***RESPONSE***

In reference to Apis, this is known as the ***Request/Response Cycle***:

APIs are what make the process easier for the 'client's' by abstracting (hiding) complex details; they provide an interface/simplified way to interact with databases and third-party applications. Programmers regularly leverage and include many different APIs to create their own applications and services.

### API Examples
Common examples of APIs used are:
* [Open Weather](https://openweathermap.org/)
  * Used for accessing weather information from a database
* [Google's Font API](https://developers.google.com/fonts?csw=1)
  * Provides an easy way to import font styles into CSS files
* [Google Maps](https://developers.google.com/maps)
  * If youve ever seen an interactable location map on a companies website, chance are they used Google's maps api
* Login using *XYZ*
  * [Facebook Login](https://developers.facebook.com/docs/facebook-login/)   
  * [Google Login](https://developers.google.com/identity/sign-in/web/sign-in)
  * [Twitter Login](https://developer.twitter.com/en/docs/authentication/guides/log-in-with-twitter)
* [Twitter Bot API](https://developer.twitter.com/en/docs/tutorials/how-to-create-a-twitter-bot-with-twitter-api-v2)
  * Allows for accounts like '@everyShrekMovieScene' or '@aceCourtBotRender'
